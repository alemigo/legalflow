    <h1>eNDA Technologies Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: December 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how ENDA Technologies, LLC (“eNDA,” “we,” “our,” “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal
      information when individuals and organizations access or use eNDA’s mobile / desktop websites, applications, platforms, artificial
      intelligence tools, electronic signature tools, document-generation tools, and related products and services (collectively, the
      “Services”).
    </p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>eNDA may act as either a data controller or a data processor depending on the context of processing, as explained below.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we process in connection with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The eNDA platform, including document creation, editing, negotiation, signature, workflow automation, AI-based features, communications and storage.</li>
      <li>Our websites, applications, marketing pages, and customer-support portals.</li>
      <li>Communications with eNDA representatives, including sales, onboarding, and support teams.</li>
      <li>Data used to provide analytics, improve the Services, and train certain AI and machine-learning models.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This policy does not apply to third-party services you integrate with eNDA, or to User Content (defined below) where your organization
      acts as the controller and eNDA acts solely as the processor.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Controller and Processor Roles</h2>

    <h3>eNDA as Processor</h3>
    <p>
      For any information that customers or their users upload, create, edit, store, or manage using the Services (“User Content”), eNDA
      processes that information only on behalf of the customer and according to the customer’s instructions. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents and templates</li>
      <li>Data fields, clauses, toggles, and redlines</li>
      <li>Uploaded files</li>
      <li>Signature workflows, audit trails, and timestamps</li>
      <li>Communications within a workspace</li>
      <li>Recipient information and workflow metadata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For User Content, the customer (or the customer’s administrator) is the data controller and is responsible for handling privacy rights
      requests related to such data.
    </p>

    <h3>eNDA as Controller</h3>
    <p>
      eNDA acts as the data controller for information we collect for our own business and operational purposes. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Billing and payment data</li>
      <li>Usage analytics and product performance data</li>
      <li>Marketing, sales, and business development</li>
      <li>Security, fraud detection, and compliance</li>
      <li>Optional identity verification features</li>
      <li>AI model training using de-identified or aggregated data (see Section 7)</li>
    </ul>
