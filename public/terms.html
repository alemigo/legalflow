    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Thank you for using eNDA Technologies through our eNDAtech.app web platform (the “Platform”) and its associated products.
      These General Terms of Service ("General Terms"), along with any applicable Additional Terms (defined below) (collectively, the “Terms”)
      cover your use and access to the products, services, software, platform, mobile and web sites including eNDAtech.app, existing
      products and future automated legal tools (collectively, "Services") provided by eNDA Technologies, LLC and any of our affiliates
      (collectively, "eNDA", “we”, “us”, “our”, “the Group” or “the Company”). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these
      General Terms as well as our Privacy Policy. If you are using our Services as the employee or agent of an organization, you are agreeing
      to these Terms on behalf of that organization. Please note that the statements set forth under the headings "More simply put" are provided
      as a courtesy solely for your convenience and are not legally binding or otherwise intended to modify these Terms in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform and Services</h2>
    <p>
      eNDA provides a platform for legal information, functionality, and self-service. Our Services do not provide legal advice and cannot be
      relied upon or include insurance or constitute an insurance product. The information provided by eNDA along with the content of our
      Services related to legal matters ("Legal Information") is provided for your private use and does not constitute legal advice. I
      understand and agree that eNDA is not a law firm or an attorney, may not perform services performed by an attorney, and its forms,
      provisions, language or templates accessible from the Platform are not a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney and eNDA
      does not review any information you provide us for legal accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide opinions about your
      selection of forms, provisions or language, or apply the law to the facts of your situation. Rather, I am representing myself in this
      legal matter. No attorney-client relationship or privilege is created with eNDA.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      If, prior to my purchase, I believe that eNDA gave me any legal advice, opinion or recommendation about my legal rights, remedies,
      defenses, options, selection of forms or strategies, I will not proceed with this purchase, and any purchase that I do make will be
      null and void.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      I understand that these Terms require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or
      class actions, and also limit the remedies available to me in the event of a dispute as described in the eNDA Arbitration Agreement,
      contained in Paragraph 16 of these Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>I UNDERSTAND THAT THE eNDA REVIEW OF MY ANSWERS MAY BE LIMITED TO COMPLETENESS, SPELLING, AND FOR INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF
      NAMES, ADDRESSES, AND THE LIKE. I WILL READ THE FINAL DOCUMENT(S) BEFORE SIGNING IT, WHERE APPLICABLE, AND AGREE TO BE SOLELY
      RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FINAL DOCUMENT(S).</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Accuracy of Information and Third-Party Consent.</h2>
    <p>
      To the best of my knowledge, I have provided accurate information to eNDA and have obtained all third-party consents required for my
      order.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Electronic Records and Signatures.</h2>
    <p>
      I give eNDA consent to store drafts and documents, affix my electronic signature or facilitate the placement of my electronic signature
      through the Platform where required to execute and file or use electronic communication services to email my documents. I understand I
      may withdraw my consent, provided my documents have not already been filed, by email eNDA Customer Care Center at
      <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Non-English-Speaking Customers.</h2>
    <p>
      I understand that certain materials on the Platform, including but not limited to questionnaires, documents, instructions, and filings,
      are only available in English. Non-English translations of these Terms, as well as other terms, conditions, and policies, are provided
      for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and
      controls.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.</h2>
    <p>
      EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, I WILL HOLD eNDA AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, INVESTORS, FOUNDERS, EXECUTIVES, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS
      HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, including but not limited to, loss, damage, theft or
      sabotage of Platform data and Services, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION
      AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
      CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY
      CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY VIOLATION BY ME OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS,
      STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN IF eNDA HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY
      LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON THE PART OF eNDA, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES AND UNDER
      NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE,
      INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO ME. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO NORTH
      CAROLINA CONSUMERS.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Terms of Use.</h2>
    <p>
      I understand that the Platform's general terms of use (the "Terms of Use") and any additional posted terms governing use of the
      Platform, including product-specific terms for eNDA (“Additional Terms”) also apply to these Terms of Service and in agreeing to these
      Terms of Service, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to those Terms of Use, which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Free tiers, trial offers, auto-renewals and paid subscriptions.</h2>
    <p>
      eNDA may make available trial offers for the limited use of the Services (each, a "Trial Offer") including to new customers who provide
      a valid payment instrument, such as a credit card or other payment method. If you choose to start a Trial Offer, you will automatically
      join the paid membership you have chosen at the end of the Trial Offer and you authorize eNDA to charge your payment method a recurring
      monthly membership fee or annual membership fee, as applicable. If you wish to use additional Services beyond those included in the Trial
      Offer, you may be asked to separately purchase those Services or to upgrade to a paid membership prior to the end of the Trial Offer
      period. Please visit our Plans and Pricing page for additional details on our available memberships. We reserve the right to change our
      pricing from time to time, but our price changes will always be prospective and not retroactive. eNDA may automatically charge you at the
      end of the trial or for a subscription renewal unless you notify us that you want to cancel or downgrade your membership. You can
      downgrade an auto-renewing paid membership to a lower cost subscription or free account at any time but your data and services
      previously available at that tier of subscription may no longer be available and subject to interruption or loss. Please notify us if
      there is an unintended issue and we work to reasonably resolve it. To ensure uninterrupted service and to enable you to conveniently
      purchase additional products and Services, eNDA will store and update (e.g. upon expiration) your payment method on file. If we are
      unable to charge your designated payment method for any reason, we reserve the right to automatically downgrade your paid plan to a
      lower-priced plan or to suspend your paid membership until your designated payment method can be charged again. Please note that it is
      your responsibility to maintain current billing information on file with our Platform.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third Party Services.</h2>
    <p>
      If I purchased a product that involves third party services, including, but not limited to, data storage partners, communication tools,
      artificial intelligence APIs, or other services integrated with or used by the Platform, I understand that I may be required to accept
      additional terms located on the third party’s site. The third party may contact me by email and/or phone with instructions on how to
      access my benefits. eNDA HEREBY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY INFORMATION, RECOMMENDATIONS, SUGGESTIONS, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
      POSTED OR OFFERED AS PART OF ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICES. eNDA IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE, MIS-REPRESENTATION OR FULFILMENT OF PRODUCTS
      OR SERVICES OFFERED OR ADVERTISED AT THOSE SITES. A THIRD PARTY MAY HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF eNDA AND THE THIRD PARTY
      WEBSITE MAY PROVIDE LESS SECURITY THAN THE eNDA SITE.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Future Products and Services.</h2>
    <p>
      If I choose to add a feature, product or service to my order subsequent to this initial purchase, these Terms of Service will apply to
      that additional product or service purchase as well.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Abandoned Orders.</h2>
    <p>
      My purchase may allow me to create my own legal documents. I understand that, other than as required by applicable law, I shall have no
      right to cancel, request a cash refund or obtain store credit for any undelivered order after 10 days have elapsed from the purchase date
      unless eNDA is reasonably at fault. All itemization of fees are displayed for convenience only. Delivered orders shall be governed by the
      eNDA Satisfaction Guarantee. Both parties acknowledge that eNDA is out of pocket time and money for undertaking the work and both parties
      fully intend to complete the order. Abandoned orders will result in liquidated damages equal to the amount paid to eNDA or the Platform
      for reimbursement of our commitment to service this order.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Exchanges.</h2>
    <p>
      I understand that I may request an exchange of one product for a different product and complete a replacement order within 30 days of my
      purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any filing fees, taxes or other third-party costs, may not be credited to my eNDA
      account. At our discretion and subject to the product or service, the price difference between the original order and the replacement
      order (less any filing fees, taxes or other third-party costs) may be credited to my original form of payment.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Termination or suspension of account and subscription.</h2>
    <p>
      eNDA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to downgrade or terminate your access to the Services, for any reason and at any time
      without prior notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of some or all of the Services if you violate these Terms or use
      the Services in a manner that may expose us to legal liability, cause negative media to our Platform, disrupt the Services or disrupt
      others' use of the Services. If eNDA elects to terminate your membership, eNDA will provide you with notice at your registered email
      address but also reserves the right to modify or discontinue, either temporarily or permanently, any part of its Services with notice.
      You agree that eNDA will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of your
      membership or access to the Services. If eNDA encounters evidence of suspicious activity in connection with my account, including, but
      not limited to, evidence that my account is being used by someone who is not authorized to do so, I acknowledge that eNDA, in its sole
      discretion, may opt to temporarily disable my account for a reasonable amount of time in order to investigate. In the event that eNDA
      terminates, suspends or disables my account, I understand that, absent a subpoena or court order, no information about my account will be
      provided to anyone outside eNDA, including me or any authorized contact, until the investigation is complete. Additionally, I understand
      that eNDA, in its sole discretion, may decide not to send any documents associated with my account to me or file any such documents with
      any government authority, while my account is disabled. I acknowledge that eNDA will not be liable for any delays, disruptions or other
      issues that may have impacted you as a result of these actions, policies and procedures.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <p><strong>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing our Customer Care Center at
      <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a>. In the unlikely event that our support is unable to resolve your
      complaint to your satisfaction (or if eNDA has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so
      informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of
      general jurisdiction. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
      jury, allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Any arbitration under these
      Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. The arbitrator shall apply the
      same limitations period that would apply in court.
    </p>

    <p>You may speak with independent counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase.</p>

    <p><strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong></p>

    <p>
      (a) eNDA and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a single arbitrator. The types of disputes and claims we
      agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted. It applies, without limitation, to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>
      <li>claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
      <li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
      <li>claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "eNDA," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
      agents, directors, founders, executives, employees, employers, business partners, shareholders, predecessors in interest, successors, and
      assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior
      agreements between us. Beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not
      preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
      against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and eNDA are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
      participate in a class action. These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration
      Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these
      Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") and email to
      the other party. A Notice to eNDA should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, eNDA, 228 Park Ave S, PMB 995086, New York,
      New York 10003, USA (the "Notice Address") and <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a> with the subject headline
      “Notice of Dispute”. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief
      sought ("Demand"). If eNDA and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 90 days after the Notice is received, you or
      eNDA may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by eNDA or you shall not be
      disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or eNDA is entitled.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association (“the AAA”) website at
      <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is $200, but this is subject to change by the arbitration provider. The
      arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by
      these Terms, for all claims under $25,000, and the applicable rules as determined by the AAA for all claims of or above $25,000, and will
      be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>
      or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that
      issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and
      interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide. Unless eNDA and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place
      in the county (or parish) of the Company’s choosing. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
      conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
      established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing. The
      parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact
      or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which eNDA was a party. If, the arbitrator finds that either
      the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
      standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse eNDA for all monies previously disbursed by it that
      are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at
      more than $25,000 (excluding attorney’s fees and expenses), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      If eNDA did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to
      receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The
      arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and
      the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling
      on the merits. In assessing whether an award that includes attorney’s fees or expenses is greater than the value of eNDA’ last written
      settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her calculations only the value of any attorney’s fees or expenses you
      reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding before eNDA’ settlement offer.
    </p>

    <p>(e) Any right to attorney's fees and expenses available under applicable law shall not obligate eNDA to any duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs.</p>

    <p>
      (f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
      provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. <strong>YOU AND eNDA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
      IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE
      CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.</strong> Further, unless both you and eNDA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
      more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may
      award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other customers. Neither you nor we
      may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other customers. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any
      of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the
      arbitration and may be brought in court.
    </p>

    <p>
      (g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $25,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a
      three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written
      arbitration award. An award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be
      selected according to AAA rules. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date
      of the appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of
      judicial review that exists under the FAA.
    </p>

    <p>
      (h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration
      provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or telephone number provided herein), that change will apply to any
      dispute of which we had written notice on the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision,
      any such termination will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to you,
      and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Installment Plan</h2>

    <p>
      (a) <strong>Qualification.</strong> The eNDA Installment Plan (the "Installment Plan") may be available as a purchase option for certain
      eNDA products priced at $500 or more. Where an Installment Plan is offered, I acknowledge that eNDA may charge a small installment fee in
      connection with this option. The total amount that will be charged for each installment payment, inclusive of any fee, will be disclosed
      to me prior to my election to participate in the Installment Plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      (b) <strong>Billing.</strong> By opting into the Installment Plan, I am agreeing to make an initial payment (the "Initial Installment
      Payment") immediately when I place my order or change my payment plan. I hereby authorize eNDA to charge my credit card for two
      additional installments on approximately, but not before, the first and second month anniversaries (each an "Installment Billing Date")
      of the Initial Installment Payment. If my purchase date is on the 29th through 31st day of any month, an Installment Billing Date for
      months with fewer days will fall on the last day of the month. Each payment will be of the same amount, except that if the total purchase
      price does not divide evenly into three parts, my final installment payment will include all outstanding amounts. I understand that I may
      pay my outstanding balance at any time without incurring additional charges.
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) <strong>Default.</strong> If my credit card is declined eNDA may make multiple attempts to bill that card. If I remain in default on
      the second payment when the third payment is due, I authorize eNDA to charge both the second and third payment amounts to my credit card.
      If three attempts to charge my card are unsuccessful and my account balance remains unpaid, I understand that eNDA may report information
      about my account to credit bureaus, and that late payments, missed payments, and other defaults may be reflected in my credit report. I
      understand that eNDA may restrict my ability to purchase other eNDA products if I am delinquent on any payment. I understand that eNDA
      may make efforts to collect a delinquent payment. I understand that if I believe eNDA has reported inaccurate information to a consumer
      reporting agency, I may email the eNDA Customer Care Center at <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a> and eNDA
      will investigate the matter. I understand that eNDA may accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that reflect "paid in full"
      or other restrictive endorsements, without limiting any of its rights under these Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      (d) <strong>Store Credit.</strong> I understand that if I have a eNDA store credit, the amount of that store credit will be deducted from
      my total purchase price before installment payment amounts are calculated. Store credit will not count against the minimum purchase price
      per product. If I want to apply a store credit issued after my enrollment in the Installment Plan, I may do so by emailing eNDA Customer
      Care Center at <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (e) <strong>Notice of Automatic Billing.</strong> eNDA may send a reminder email to the email address of record for my account before my
      Installment Billing Dates. I acknowledge and agree that this notice is provided as a courtesy only, and eNDA is not obligated or required
      to provide such notice. I acknowledge and agree that (i) my failure to read, (ii) my inability to receive, or (iii) the failure of eNDA to
      send the email does not create any liability on the part of eNDA or any third-party service provider and it does not invalidate the
      billing notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      (f) <strong>Disputed Charges.</strong> I understand that if I dispute a charge to my credit card, I should email eNDA Customer Care Center
      at <a href="mailto:support@eNDAtech.app">support@eNDAtech.app</a> and eNDA will investigate the matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      (g) <strong>Account Information.</strong> I agree to notify eNDA immediately of any changes to my credit card number, its expiration date,
      and/or my billing address, or if my credit card expires or is cancelled for any reason. I understand that if my failure to provide eNDA
      with accurate, complete, and current information results in delinquent payments, eNDA may restrict my ability to purchase other eNDA
      products, rescind availability or access to the Company’s services, report information about this delinquency to credit bureaus, and/or
      pursue further collection efforts of the outstanding and unpaid balances.
    </p>

    <p>
      (h) <strong>Subscription Products.</strong> For subscription products offering the Installment Plan, eNDA reserves the right to terminate
      access to subscription benefits 31 days after a missed installment payment.
    </p>
